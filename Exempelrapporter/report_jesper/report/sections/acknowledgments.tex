First off I would like to thank my examiner Simin Nadjm-Tehrani and my supervisor Massimiliano Raciti for taking the time to examine and supervise me during my master thesis. Your feedback have been really helpful and encouraging.  

The master thesis was carried out at Valtech in Stockholm. It has been a real pleasure to be surrounded by professionals in diverse areas during the thesis, it has really helped me to look at the thesis from different angles. A special thanks goes to my supervisor and Javascript-guru Johannes Edelstam, I'm really grateful for all the help and support!
