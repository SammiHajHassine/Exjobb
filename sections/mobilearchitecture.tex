\section{Mobile Information Architecture}

The success rate of mobile websites does not solely depend on how it is designed and it’s layout, a great deal is determined on the content of the site and how structured and organized, which in other words can be referred to as the websites’ information architecture (ref mobile design and development). Information architecture can affect both the appearance of websites, as well as their usability, why it is an important part of the development process.

\subsection{Definition of Information Architecture}

Bryan Fling describes, in “Mobile Design and Development”, the definition of information architecture with the help of the following outline:

•	The structural design of shared information environments
•	The combination of organizations, labeling, search, and navigation systems within websites and intranets
•	The art and science of shaping information products and experiences to support usability and findability
•	An emerging discipline and community of practice focused on bringing principles of design and architecture to the digital landscape
