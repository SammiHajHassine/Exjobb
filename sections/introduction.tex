\section{Introduction}

Web development is a field that rapidly evolves, and web developers continuously need to keep themselves updated of new techniques and trends regarding the subject. The visual design and functionality of websites has gone through a great change since the early beginning of webpages, and the number of users on the Internet has increased immensely. Most companies, or organizations today, present themselves and their products or services with the help of websites. Many of these sites include and various types of Internet services that for example enables online purchases, online booking etc. Website browsing is an essential part of the contemporary lifestyle, which stresses the need for efficient and proficient techniques concerning web development. 

There are an enormous number of websites on the Internet today \cite{internetsize}(ref: http://www.worldwidewebsize.com), which suggests the need of good web development techniques that can enable websites to differentiate themselves, and be successful. In order for a website to be successful, when it comes to popularity amongst users, various approaches are possible and different aspects should be considered. For example, how a users interact with a website, or how visually pleasant the site is could be important. However, the process of increasing the success rate of a website in practice can also vary and depend on various factors such as the type of content on the site, the reputation of the organization to whom the website belongs to etc. One thing that most people, or organizations surely benefits from is, careful planning process that includes a discussion around what would be most suitable for their website. 

In addition to the various amount of factors and aspects that can be regarded when developing a website people today largely use other devices than desktop computers to browse on websites, such as smartphones and tablets. This fact has introduce new challenges regarding web development and needs for new ideas and methods that are applicable to these newer means of accessing websites.

The visual design and functionality of websites has gone through a great change since the early beginning of webpages, and the number of users on the Internet has increased immensely. Most companies, or organizations today, present themselves, and their products or services with the help of websites. Many of these sites include and various types of Internet services that for example enable online purchases, online ticket booking etc. Website browsing is an essential part of the contemporary lifestyle, which stresses the need for efficient and proficient techniques concerning web development. There are an enormous number of websites on the Internet today (ref: http://www.worldwidewebsize.com), which suggests the need of good web development techniques that can enable websites to differentiate themselves amongst all other sites, and become successful or popular. In order for a website to be successful, or popular, various approaches are possible and different aspects can be considered. The process of increasing the success rate of a website in practice can vary and depend on various factors such as the type of content on the site, the reputation of the organization to whom the website belongs to, the design of the site etc. In summary, a careful planning process of websites is preferable. In addition to the various amount of factors and aspects that can be regarded when developing a website, people today largely use other devices than desktop computers to browse on websites, such as smartphones and tablets. According to ÒStatCounter Global StatsÓ, Internet access through mobile devices has increased from 0.7\% in January 2009, to 8.5\% in January 2012 \cite{global stats}. This rapid increase could be regarded as an indication on that effort should be put into the development of mobile webpages. The increase of mobile browsing has brought new challenges to the field web development and introduced needs for new ideas and methods that cope with the features of mobile devices. Therefore, the results when developing a website should preferably not only work, and be useful on computers, but that also be suitable for a mobile format 



\subsection{Problem Description}
In the field of mobile web development the issue regarding presentation of information often arises. The information presented could ideally be structured in a way that enhances the experience of the visiting users. Hence, the layout and structure of a websiteâ€™s information can be crucial to its success. This issue can clearly aggravate in relation to the amount of information presented. 

Another problem that is in direct relation to the layout of information is how to display hierarchal information. Information structured in a hierarchal manner on a website takes shape in such a way that all information available on the site cannot be viewed at once, and in order to view certain information navigation through the hierarchy is necessary, i.e. clicking on certain web elements, such as links or buttons, in a relatively predetermined order. One of the essential parts of this issue is the configuration and design of the navigation through the hierarchy because if it is overcomplicated to find certain information, users will probably be frustrated and annoyed. 

It can be an even greater issue to present hierarchal information on mobile websites in comparison to a desktop websites. Websites presented on a computer screen can display more content at once and provide a more comprehensive overview of the information than on a mobile device. Furthermore, the complexity of the information presentation is enlarged by the fact that mobile browsing is performed with the help of usersâ€™ fingers, unlike computers that are being controlled by a mouse. In addition, usersâ€™ fingers, in many cases, relatively large in relation to size of the screen on a mobile phone. Therefore, solutions to the problem where as much information as possible is being presented on the phone's reasonably small screen, will probably fail in a user experience point of view. The challenge lies in finding ways to present hierarchal information with its belonging navigation structure that are efficient and intuitive, and which does not affect the user experience in a negative way. 

The problem that this thesis aims to analyze is the presentation of websites containing hierarchal information with a navigational structure in a mobile interface. A user experience point of view will form the basis for the analysis.

\subsection{Limitations}
The concept of mobile devices will in this thesis only cover the mobile phone. Another system that can be categorized as a mobile device is the "Tablet", such as the "iPad". An investigation on the presentation of websites with hierarchal information on tablets could be of interest as well, but the screen size of tablets does not differ as much from on a desktop computer in comparison with the mobile phone. Furthermore, it is usually not as a significant problem in the development of these types of websites on tablets.

This thesis will also be limited in the number of investigated solutions. There exist a variety of solutions to the problem that this thesis aims to analyze, but due to a limited time span the maximum number of investigated solutions will be 2 or 3.
